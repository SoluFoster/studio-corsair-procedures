Like a growning numbers of Engineersdwada, I use [Slack]() more than email for professional electronic communication. If you haven't heard of Slack yet, prepare to have your mind blown.

Watch their cute propaganda.

Slack is a free professional program for teams. Everyone I've introduced to it loves it (and you will as well).

## If you don't have a Slack team for your project yet
If you don't have Slack, then [create a new team](https://slack.com/create#email) for your organization (it's free!), add a cool logo for your team (if you have one), and then [invite](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-Slack-team) me to it and give my account the permissions to add [apps](https://studiocorsair.slack.com/apps) to your Slack team. 

## If you already have a Slack team for your project
If you already have a Slack team for your project, then simply [invite](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201330256-Invite-new-members-to-your-Slack-team) me to it and give my account the permissions to add [apps](https://studiocorsair.slack.com/apps) to your Slack team.
